# ðŸ¤–S.A.M stands for Salty.Assistant.Machine
A voice command assistant bot named S.A.M. More features to be added in the future

### Automating boring stuff using voice commands, using the -
- Speech_Recognition library, 
- SoundDevice, 
- SoundFile,
- PyAutoGUI

### Features:
- Opens whichever program you have - just say "open {program name}"
- types whatever you want - say "write {sentence}"
- search your browser - say "search {query}" 

The bot sends data to Google to process, otherwise this would have been a near impossible project, atleast for now! My bot basically takes mic input, processes it and does whatever is asked! 

**speech.wav is overwritten everytime the script is run, but it will also be created automatically if deleted.**
