# voice_commands_automation
Automating boring stuff using voice commands, using the -
Speech_Recognition library, 
SoundDevice
SoundFile, and 
the truly beautiful PyAutoGUI

The bot sends data to Google to process, otherwise this would have been a near impossible project, atleast for now! My bot basically takes mic input, processes it and does whatever is asked!

Bot name - S.A.M
salty.ass.machine

if you want to use the bot yourself, clone the repository, install the modules listed above, and run bot.py, nothing else
